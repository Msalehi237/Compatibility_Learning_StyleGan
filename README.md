## 2. Importance of Categories

There are two types of categories in the [MetaData](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13-J4fAPZahauaGycw3j_YvbAHO7tOTW5/view), i.e. **category_id** and **semantic_category**.
A possible explaination for the performance of the existing Compatibility Learning models is that these models are learning categories. We discuss that if there is similar categories in the negetive outfit samples (low quality negative samples), the model can perform well in compatibility learning task when it only learns categories. To evaluate this assumption, we train some predictive models on the dataset when only the category of the images are present in the dataset.

### Training on category_id
